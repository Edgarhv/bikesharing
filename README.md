## Overview
In this challenge, I worked with data visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. First, I learned how to import, style, and portray data accurately. Secondly, This analysis required analysts to used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a DateTime datatype. Finally, I created worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset.


## Resources

- Pandas

## Summary

During the summer of August 2019 in New York, males were the primary users of CitiBikes. Also, They use the most on Thursdays. The location of starting and ending trips were the same.

Additional, We need to understand that New York is different of Des Moines, Iowa. It would be a Good idea to make a comparision of weather between the cities. Both cities have different weather, and if there temperatures and weather are not similar, this may also provide a stronger case to investors that Citibikes is not a great fit for Des Moines, Iowa. On the other, Des Moines is a smaller city. We can ajust the study to a smaller city and it will work.
