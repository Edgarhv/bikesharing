## Overview
In this challenge, I worked with data visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. First, I learned how to import, style, and portray data accurately. Secondly, This analysis required analysts to used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a DateTime datatype. Finally, I created worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset.
